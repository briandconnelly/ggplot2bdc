I recently wrote about my workflow for [Analyzing Microbial Growth with
R](http://bconnelly.net/2014/04/analyzing-microbial-growth-with-r/). Perhaps
the most important part of that process is the **plate map**, which describes
the different experimental variables and where they occur. In the example case,
the plate map described which strain was growing and in which environment for
each of the wells used in a 96-well microtiter plate. Until recently, I've
always created two plate maps. The first one is hand-drawn using pens and
markers and sat on the bench with me when I started an experiment. By marking
the wells with different colors, line types, and whatever other hieroglyphics I
decide on, I can keep track of where everything is and how to inoculate the
wells.

The second is a CSV file that contains a row for each well that I use and
columns describing the values of each of my experimental variables. This file
contains all of the information that I had on my hand-drawn plate map, but in a
format that I can later merge with my result data to produce a fully-annotated
data set. The fully-annotated data set is the perfect format for plotting with
tools like [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.org/) or for sharing with others.

<pre>
    Well Strain Environment
 1    B2      A           1
 2    B3      B           1
 3    B4      C           1
 4    B5     &lt;NA&gt;         1
 5    B6      A           2
 6    B7      B           2
 7    B8      C           2
 8    B9     &lt;NA&gt;         2
 9   B10      A           3
 10  B11      B           3
</pre>

But when talking with [Carrie
Glenney](http://kerrlab.org/Public/CarrieGlenney), whom I've been convincing of
the awesomeness of the CSV/dplyr/ggplot workflow, I realized that there's
really no need to have two separate plate maps. Since all the information is in
the CSV plate map, why bother drawing one out on paper? This post describes how
I've started using ggplot2 to create a nice plate map image that I can print and
take with me to the bench or paste in my lab notebook.


## Reading in the Plate Map

First, load load your plate map file into R. You may need to first change your
working directory with `setwd` or give `read.csv` the full path of the plate
map file.

```{r read plate map,tidy=FALSE}
platemap <- read.csv("platemap.csv")
```

If you don't yet have a plate map of your own, you can use this [sample plate
map](http://bconnelly.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/platemap.csv).


## Extracting Row and Column Numbers

In my plate maps, I refer to each well by its row-column pair, like "C6". To
make things easier to draw, we're going to be splitting those well IDs into
their row and column numbers. So for "C6", we'll get row 3 and column 6. This
process is easy with dplyr's `mutate` function. If you haven't installed dplyr,
you can get it by running `install.packages('dplyr')`.

```{r split well into rows and columns,tidy=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

platemap <- mutate(platemap,
                   Row=as.numeric(match(toupper(substr(Well,1,1)), LETTERS)),
                   Column=as.numeric(substr(Well,2,5)))
```

Once this is done, the `platemap` data frame will now have two additional
columns, **Row** and **Column**, which contain the row and column numbers
associated with the well in the **Well** column, respectively.

## Drawing the Plate

Microtiter plates are arranged in a grid, so it's not a big leap to think about
a plate as a plot containing the row values along the Y axis and the column
values along the X axis. So let's use ggplot2 to create a scatter plot of all
of the wells in the plate map. We'll also give it a title.

```{r plot part 1,tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=platemap, aes(x=Column, y=Row)) +
    geom_point(size=10) +
    labs(title="Plate Layout for My Experiment")
```

As you can see, this plot doesn't tell us anything about our experiment other
than the wells it uses and their location.


## Showing Empty Wells

I often don't use all 96 wells in my experiments. It is useful, however, to
show all of them. This makes it obvious which wells are used and helps orient
your eyes when shifting between the plate map and the plate.  Because of this,
we'll create some white circles with a light grey border for all 96 wells
*below* the points that we've already created. We'll also change the aspect
ratio of the plot so that it better matches the proportions of a 96-well plate.

```{r plot2 blank wells and aspect ratio,tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(data=platemap, aes(x=Column, y=Row)) +
    geom_point(data=expand.grid(seq(1,12), seq(1,8)), aes(x=Var1, y=Var2),
               color='grey90', fill='white', shape=21, size=6) +
    geom_point(size=10) +
    coord_fixed(ratio=(13/12)/(9/8), xlim=c(0.5,12.5), ylim=c(0.5,8.5)) +
    labs(title="Plate Layout for My Experiment")
```


## Flipping the Axis

Now that we are showing all 96 wells, one thing becomes clear---the plot
arranges the rows from 1 on the bottom to 8 at the top, which is opposite of
how microtiter plates are labeled. Fortunately, we can easily flip the Y axis.
While we're at it, we'll also tell the Y axis to use letters instead of numbers
and to draw these labels for each value. Similarly, we'll label each column
value along the X axis.

```{r plot 3 flip y axis,tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(data=platemap, aes(x=Column, y=Row)) +
    geom_point(data=expand.grid(seq(1,12), seq(1,8)), aes(x=Var1, y=Var2),
               color='grey90', fill='white', shape=21, size=6) +
    geom_point(size=10) +
    coord_fixed(ratio=(13/12)/(9/8), xlim=c(0.5,12.5), ylim=c(0.5,8.5)) +
    scale_y_reverse(breaks=seq(1,8), labels=LETTERS[1:8]) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,12)) +
    labs(title="Plate Layout for My Experiment")
```

For those who would like to mimic the look of a microtiter plate even more
closely, I have some bad news. It's not possible to place the X axis labels
above the plot. Not without some complicated tricks, at least.


## Removing Grids and other Plot Elements

Although the plot is starting to look a lot like a microtiter plate, there's
still some unnecessary "chart junk", such as grids and tick marks along the
axes. To create a more straightforward plate map, we can apply a theme that
will strip these elements out. My theme for doing this (`theme_bdc_microtiter`)
is available as part of the
[ggplot2bdc](https://github.com/briandconnelly/ggplot2bdc) package. Follow that
link for installation instructions. Once installed, we can now apply the theme:

```{r theme,tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2bdc)

ggplot(data=platemap, aes(x=Column, y=Row)) +
    geom_point(data=expand.grid(seq(1,12), seq(1,8)), aes(x=Var1, y=Var2),
               color='grey90', fill='white', shape=21, size=6) +
    geom_point(size=10) +
    coord_fixed(ratio=(13/12)/(9/8), xlim=c(0.5,12.5), ylim=c(0.5,8.5)) +
    scale_y_reverse(breaks=seq(1,8), labels=LETTERS[1:8]) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,12)) +
    labs(title="Plate Layout for My Experiment") +
    theme_bdc_microtiter()
```


## Highlighting Experimental Variables

Now that our plot is nicely formatted, it's time to get back to the main point
of all of this---displaying the values of the different experimental variables.

You'll first need to think about how to best *encode* each of these values. For
this, ggplot provides a number of *aesthetics*, such as color, shape, size, and
opacity.  There are no one-size-fits-all rules for this. If you're interested in
this topic, Jacques Bertin's classic *Semiology of Graphics* has some great
information, and [Jeff Heer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/) and [Mike
Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)'s [*Crowdsourcing Graphical Perception: Using Mechanical Turk to Assess Visualization Design*](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/crowdsourcing-graphical-perception/) is very interesting. After a
little experimentation you should be able to figure out which encodings best
represent your data.

You'll also need to consider the data types of the experimental variables,
because it's not possible to map a shape or some other discrete property to
continuous values.

Here, we'll show the different environments using shapes, and the different
strains using color. When R imported the plate map, it interpreted the
Environment variable as continuous (not a crazy assumption, since it has values
1, 2, and 3). We're first going to be transforming it to a categorical variable
(*factor* in R speak) so that we can map it to a shape. We'll then pass our
encodings to ggplot as the `aes` argument to `geom_point`.

```{r full plot,tidy=FALSE}
platemap$Environment <- as.factor(platemap$Environment)

ggplot(data=platemap, aes(x=Column, y=Row)) +
    geom_point(data=expand.grid(seq(1,12), seq(1,8)), aes(x=Var1, y=Var2),
               color='grey90', fill='white', shape=21, size=6) +
    geom_point(aes(shape=Environment, colour=Strain), size=10) +
    coord_fixed(ratio=(13/12)/(9/8), xlim=c(0.5,12.5), ylim=c(0.5,8.5)) +
    scale_y_reverse(breaks=seq(1,8), labels=LETTERS[1:8]) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,12)) +
    labs(title="Plate Layout for My Experiment") +
    theme_bdc_microtiter()
```


## Changing Colors, Shapes, Etc.

By default, ggplot will use a default ordering of shapes and colors. If you'd
prefer to use a different set, either because they make the data more easy to
interpret (see [Sharon Lin](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~sharonl/) and
[Jeffrey Heer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/)'s fascinating [*The
Right Colors Make Data Easier To
Read*](http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/04/the-right-colors-make-data-easier-to-read/))
or for some other reason, we can adjust them. I'll change the colors used to
blue, red, and black, which I normally associate with these strains.  Although
these colors aren't quite as aesthetically pleasing as ggplot2's defaults, I
use them because they are the colors of markers I have at my bench.

```{r scale colors,tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(data=platemap, aes(x=Column, y=Row)) +
    geom_point(data=expand.grid(seq(1,12), seq(1,8)), aes(x=Var1, y=Var2),
               color='grey90', fill='white', shape=21, size=6) +
    geom_point(aes(shape=Environment, colour=Strain), size=10) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("A"="blue", "B"="red", "C"="black")) +
    coord_fixed(ratio=(13/12)/(9/8), xlim=c(0.5,12.5), ylim=c(0.5,8.5)) +
    scale_y_reverse(breaks=seq(1,8), labels=LETTERS[1:8]) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,12)) +
    labs(title="Plate Layout for My Experiment") +
    theme_bdc_microtiter()
```


## Wrap-Up

And that's all it takes! You can now save the plot using `ggsave`, print it,
add it to some slides, or anything else. In the future, I'll describe a similar
visualizations that can be made that allow exploration of the annotated data
set, which contains the plate map information along with the actual data.
